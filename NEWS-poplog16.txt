AMD64 (64 bit)

=======================

To save the need to edit this file each time there's a new version of
poplog_baseN.tar.bz2 I've created a symbolic link

    poplog_latest_base.tar.bz2

at the time this note was written it was linked to poplog_base6.tar.bz2
That may change.

NCURSES NEWS

(slightly edited):

It was noted that some Linux systems have only ncurses version 5, while
others have only version 6.  Executables linked to non-present version of
the library can not run, so it is not possible to have a single executable
that runs on a large variety of Linux system and which is linked with
ncurses.

So to ease recompiling Poplog I have created corepop which does not link to
ncurses.  ATM I do not know what is best way to do this.  I simply removed
'termcap.p' from 'pop/src'. Moving it to 'pop/ved/src' and adjusting
sources so that they still compile allow building 'basepop11' linked to
ncurses from the same source.  I do not know why 'termcap.p' is in
'pop/src'.  It seems that in the base system only ved needs termcap (more
precisely terminfo) functions so it seem resonable to move 'termcap.p' to
the Ved directory. Is there a better solution?

Anyway, at

 http://www.math.uni.wroc.pl/~hebisch/poplog/poplog_base6.tar.bz2
 copied to this directory (4.6MB)

 http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/amd64/poplog16/poplog_base6.tar.bz2

This tarball contains a new corepop.  I also slightly modified 'pglink' so
that it does not build 'rsvpop11' when '-core' is given.  There are no
other changes compared to version 5 tarball (in particular corepop built
from the tarball is linked to ncurses).
